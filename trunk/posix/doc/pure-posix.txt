:Authors: Mike Maul <mike.maul@gmail.com> 
:License: GPL V3, see the accompanying COPYING file

This wrapper exposes constants and libc socket functions 
defined in sys/socket.h. Additionally wappers are provided
for certain functions relying on C struts.

For examples see the examples directory
This extension is a work in progress. 

:Name: ``make-sockaddr`` - create sockaddr structure 
:Synopsis: ``make-sockaddr::pointer_t <family::int> <address::string> <port::int>``
:Description: Creates the sockaddr stucture necessary 
              for binding and using sockets. This is difficult to do in pure pure
              so a c wrapper was created.
              <family::int> is one of the address family constants. 
              Address family constants are prefixed by AF.
              <address::string> is a string represention of a IP address.
              for server sockets this will be the IP address of the interface
              you wish to bind to. To bind to all interfaces use ''*''
              <port::int> is the port number to be used

              The return value is an pointer to the sock_addr_in structure 

:See Also: socket(2)

:Name: `` bind_socket`` - binds socket
:Synopsis: ``bind_socket::pointer_t <sockfd::int> <address::pointer to sockaddr>``
:Description: Binds socket to sockaddr sturcture
              for binding and using sockets.
              <sockfd::int> file descriptor returned from socket
              <address::pointer to sockaddr> pointer returned from make sockaddr.

              The return value is an int success in indicated by a non negative result.

:Name: `` accept_socket`` - accepts connections
:Synopsis: ``accept_socket::int <sockfd::int> <address::pointer to sockaddr>``
:Description: Accepts connction requests on socket bound to sockfd

              <sockfd::int> file descriptor returned from socket
              <address::pointer to sockaddr> pointer returned from make sockaddr.

              The return value is on success a file descriptor for the connection.
              On failure the value will be -1.

:See Also: accept(2)

:Name: `` fdopen`` - open a FILE object for a file descriptor
:Synopsis: ``fdopen::int <sockfd::int> <modes:string>``
:Description: While not posix, included to be able to using existing IO functions
              on socket file descriptors. FOr the most part mode should be "r+"

              The return value on success is a pointer to a FILE structure 
              otherwise a NULL is returned.
