pure-posix - POSIX Library interface for Pure
=============================================

:Authors: - Mike Maul<mike.maul@gmail.com>

This is a library containg bindings for the POSIX system interface. It is not
complete but attempts to implement some of the more commenly used
interfaces. Currently implemented is a socket interface and fork.

Installation
============

Run ``make`` to compile the module and ``make install`` (as root) to install
it in the Pure library directory. This requires GNU make, and of course you
need to have Pure installed. It is also necessary to have an operating system
that is POSIX compatible as well as the header files available. Additionally 
pure-gen is used to generate the base bindings. However if pure-gen is not 
installed pregenerated base bindings are included in the distribution tarball
at http://code.google.com/p/pure-lang-extras/. 

``make`` tries to guess your Pure installation directory and platform-specific
setup. If it gets this wrong, you can set some variables manually. In
particular, ``make install prefix=/usr`` sets the installation prefix, and
``make PIC=-fPIC`` or some similar flag might be needed for compilation on 64
bit systems. 

Other useful build targets are
* html      -- builds html documentation
* pdf       -- builds pdf documentation
* dist      -- build distrubtuion copy of source package
* clean     -- removes compiled files
* realclean -- removes all generated and compiled files (Dont do this if pure-gen is not installed)
* uninstall -- uninstalls package

Usage
=====

This library is has functionality divided into to seperate modules. All
modules have a parent namespace of ``posix``. The socket module has the
namespace of ``posix::socket`` and the fork module has the namespace of
``posix::fork``.

For more information see the pure-posix documentation and the programs in the
example directory.
