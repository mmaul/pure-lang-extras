This is a project templet for build pure library extensions.
To implement your library edit the Makefile ass apropriate.
Usful make targets are discussed below.

Installation
============

** GENERIC INSTRUCTIONS **
Run ``make`` to compile the module and ``make install`` (as root) to install
it in the Pure library directory. This requires GNU make, and of course you
need to have Pure installed. 

``make`` tries to guess your Pure installation directory and platform-specific
setup. If it gets this wrong, you can set some variables manually. In
particular, ``make install prefix=/usr`` sets the installation prefix, and
``make PIC=-fPIC`` or some similar flag might be needed for compilation on 64
bit systems. 

Other useful build targets are
html  -- builds html documentation
pdf   -- builds pdf documentation
dist  -- build distrubtuion copy of source package
clean -- removes all generated and compiled files 
         (Dont do this if pure-gen is not installed)
